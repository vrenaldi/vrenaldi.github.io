**Welcome to my portfolio website.**

The idea behind this website is a "live" business card.  
On the front side of the card, you can see my contact.  
When you flip (click) the card, you can see the skills and projects sections.

The size of the card (aspect ratio) is based on [ISO/IEC 7810], ID-1.

| Format               | Dimensions           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ID-1                 | 85.60 Ã— 53.98 mm     |

There might be still some breakdown when the aspect ratio is heavily violated, e.g. 1:1.
