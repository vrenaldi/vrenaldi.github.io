**Welcome to my portfolio website.**

This project was built using HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS) and TypeScript.  
The idea behind the project is a "live" business card.

My contact information can be found on the front side of the card.  
Flip (click) the card to see the skills and projects sections.

The size of the card (aspect ratio) is based on [ISO/IEC 7810], ID-1.

| Format               | Dimensions           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ID-1                 | 85.60 Ã— 53.98 mm     |
